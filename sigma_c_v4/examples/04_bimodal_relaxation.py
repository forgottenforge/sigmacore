"""
Example 4 -- Bimodal relaxation: regime II in the wild.

A two-state system relaxing via two channels with rates 1/tau_fast and
1/tau_slow:
   O(t) = a * exp(-t / tau_fast) + (1 - a) * exp(-t / tau_slow)

When the two scales are well-separated (tau_slow / tau_fast > 5), chi_O
shows two clear peaks -- regime II. v4 returns sigma_c as a list of peak
locations, not a single number.

Aha effect:
  A system with two characteristic times has two sigma_c values, not one
  averaged value. v4 surfaces this honestly instead of silently picking
  the bigger peak.

Real-world analogues:
  - Glass relaxation (alpha and beta processes)
  - Quantum decoherence with two noise channels
  - Server latency: TCP retry + DB query in series
